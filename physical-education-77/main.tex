In this DeCal, we will work to improve physical fitness, endurance, and respiratory strength through fun and engaging workouts. Our daily warm up will be the walk to the top of the Big C, and from there we will engage in different workout programs such as Just Dance, Wii Sports, and other virtual fitness games and programs. Students will learn a variety of fitness techniques in class that they can apply to their everyday fitness schedule. By the end of this course, students will have a large knowledge of workouts to improve their own fitness, as is the goal of the Physical Education program at UC Berkeley.




\section{Course Requirements and Policies}

All students must have a fun and positive attitude toward trying new things. There are no prior pre-requisites necessary to take this course. There is one required reading which will help to build on the information covered in the class. The material from the book will be included in the final physical test.\\
\\
Required Reading: The 4-Hour Body by Tim Ferriss \\

Add stuff about attendance, technology in class, academic honesty, plagiarism, etc.

\section{Office Hours}
It is highly encouraged that students attend office hours. This time is crucial for students to ask questions on subjects they struggle with, expand their knowledge, and get to know the instructors. They are crucial for the success in this course.
