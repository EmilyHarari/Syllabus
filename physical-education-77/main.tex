In this DeCal, we will work to improve physical fitness, endurance, and respiratory strength through fun and engaging workouts. Our daily warm up will be the walk to the top of the Big C, and from there we will engage in different workout programs such as Just Dance, Wii Sports, and other virtual fitness games and programs. Students will learn a variety of fitness techniques in class that they can apply to their everyday fitness schedule. By the end of this course, students will have a large knowledge of workouts to improve their own fitness, as is the goal of the Physical Education program at UC Berkeley.  

Emily's office hours: M, W 2-3 PM at Memorial Glade. Loren: T, Th 5-6 AM at Free Speech Movement Cafe. Rachel: Th, F 1-3 PM at Faculty Glade. Melissa: T, W 5-7 PM at Pat Brown's Cafe.
